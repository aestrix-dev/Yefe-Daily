## 📱 How to Configure Your WhatsApp and Telegram Links

### **WhatsApp Group Setup**

   In `profile_viewmodel.dart` line 271, replace:
   ```dart
   const whatsappGroupUrl = 'https://chat.whatsapp.com/YOUR_GROUP_INVITE_CODE';
   ```
   
   With your actual link:
   ```dart
   const whatsappGroupUrl = 'https://chat.whatsapp.com/ABC123xyz';
   ```

### **Telegram Channel/Group Setup**

1. **Create Telegram Channel or Group:**
   - Open Telegram
   - Create your "Towel Talk" channel/group
   - Set a public username (e.g., @toweltalk_yefa)

2. **Get Channel Link:**
   - Channel Info → Edit → Username
   - Your link will be: `https://t.me/toweltalk_yefa`

3. **Update the Code:**
   In `profile_viewmodel.dart` line 302, replace:
   ```dart
   const telegramChannelUrl = 'https://t.me/YOUR_CHANNEL_USERNAME';
   ```
   
   With your actual link:
   ```dart
   const telegramChannelUrl = 'https://t.me/toweltalk_yefa';
   ```
