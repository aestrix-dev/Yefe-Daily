## ðŸ“² iPhone Audio Widget Setup

### **Control Center Widget**
The audio controls are automatically available in Control Center - no setup needed!

### **Lock Screen Widget**
Audio controls appear automatically on lock screen when audio is playing.

### **Home Screen Widget** (iOS 14+)
Unfortunately, third-party audio apps cannot add widgets directly to the iPhone home screen for media controls. However:

1. **Control Center Access**: 
   - Swipe down from top-right â†’ instant access to controls
   
2. **Lock Screen**: 
   - Always shows controls when audio is playing
   
3. **Siri Integration** (future enhancement):
   - "Hey Siri, play Yefa Daily"
   - "Hey Siri, pause my audio"

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### **No Controls Appear**
```
Problem: Lock screen shows no audio controls
Solution:
1. Ensure audio is actually playing (not paused)
2. Check iOS settings â†’ Face ID & Passcode â†’ Allow access when locked: "Media & Apple Pay" should be ON
3. Restart audio playback
```

### **Controls Don't Work**
```
Problem: Buttons appear but don't respond
Solution:
1. Force close and restart Yefa Daily app
2. Check iOS Settings â†’ Privacy & Security â†’ Microphone (ensure Yefa Daily has permission)
3. Restart iPhone if needed
```

### **No App Icon in Controls**
```
Problem: Generic music icon instead of Yefa logo
Solution:
1. This is normal behavior - iOS sometimes uses generic icons
2. Your app name "Yefa Daily" will still appear
3. Functionality is not affected
```

### **Bluetooth Issues**
```
Problem: Headphone controls don't work
Solution:
1. Disconnect and reconnect Bluetooth device
2. Check iOS Settings â†’ Bluetooth â†’ [Device] â†’ Media Audio is ON
3. Try with different Bluetooth device to isolate issue
```
