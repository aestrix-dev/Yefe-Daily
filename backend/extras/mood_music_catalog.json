One can effectively hear the title spoken out loud as \"Here is all of my Love\". But they would be wrong.   I don't like the usage of aerosols in applications where there are other delivery methods available. #ClawBangs",

The notes and chords were generated algorithmically (not by an AI). https://sites.research.google/tonetransfer  0:33 there is an amazingly smooth and correct sounding run-up.  0:50 it goes below the actual tenor sax range. I love how it extrapolated down there! 0:58 there's some leak hiss going on at 0:58. I'll call that \"artistic license\". 1:08 it goes quite a bit above the standard range for a tenor sax, but those notes should be available in altissimo with some fancy fingerings. 2:20 you can almost taste the spit! 2:58 it plays the same note back to back, but changes the tone of the note. Very cool.  This ToneTransfer AI Sax is amazing. Getting this level of detail in a recording with standard virtual instruments is almost impossible. AI for the win!",

Nothing bovine on this street, Nay! ... ... ... Wait... I was trying to make a joke involving a horse's \"neigh\" combined with the archaic positive/negative usage of \"nay\". Then everything went wrong, and I said almost the opposite of the intention. So, without the joke: Picture a street where the only animals are the horsiest of horses... No cows or pigs. Okay, there are two dogs... but one of them is pretty small... and you can see a cat in one of the windows... but MOSTLY horses. If you added up the weights of all the non-horse, non-humans in the picture, they would weigh less than one horse.",

I'm sure it was a nice car. I've never owned one. But there were a lot of them! The late 70's Thunderbirds are particularly horrifying... They had those headlight covers that flipped up... because that was a good idea at some point. But this piece! Oh! This piece! Atmosphere like you wouldn't believe! The flute is just so earthy! The organic drones are also beautiful. The whole thing is beautiful. Kind of like you went to an alien day spa in another dimension where days last for years, but you still never get all wrinkly when you're in the bubbly warm waters. mmmm... bubbly warm waters... with the slight possibility of a serial killer.

My newest piece studies, experiences and isomorphically dominates a variety of structured tension-hemiolas. In short, the method must never present the sound-world. I never examine continuities, despite the fact that any gesture or non-linearity can be, and has been interpreted as a rather orchestrally-monophonic set of 'canon-aerophones'. In my most recent work, vibrations, materials and rhythmic oscillations are all used within chaotically-transdisciplinary gestures, allowing the audience to improvise a variety of symbolic idioms. I am very much influenced by the idea of dismissing popular solos, particularly whilst combined with a highly polyrhythmic approach to spaces. Download comes in one faster and one slower tempo.

The pizzicato strings provide the rhythm in the first half, while strings and horns play the melody. A harp accompanies a celeste in creating transitions between segments of the music. As the music crescendos into the third minute, the frivolity turns more serious, and the piece ends with a few interchangeable chords between the celeste and the horns.<BR>",
